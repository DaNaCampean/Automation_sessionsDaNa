    Requirements:

            - String operations

    Checkpoint exercise(s) to be solved during meeting:

            1. Write a method reverseString(String str) that takes a string and returns it reversed.

            2. Write a method countVowels(String str) that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

            3. Write a method areAnagrams(String str1, String str2) that checks if two given strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order).

            4. Write a method replaceCharacter(String str, char oldChar, char newChar) that replaces all occurrences of oldChar with newChar in the given string.

            5. Write a method isPalindrome(String str) that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

            6. Write a method charFrequency(String str, char c) that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.

            7. Write a method isTermInList(List<String> list, String term) that checks if the list has an element containing the provided term.

8. Write a method areTermsInList(List<String> list, List<String> searchedTerms) that checks if the list has elements containing the provided terms.

            9. Write a method getFirstInteger(String text) that retrieves the first sequence of digits from a string.

            10. Write a method checkIfTextContainsTerms(String text, boolean ignoreCase, List<String> termsList) that checks if text contains all specified terms with an option to ignore case sensitivity.

11. Write a method insertStringInTextRepeatedly(String text, String stringToBeInserted, int distance) that will insert the given string in the specified text at every specified interval (distance).

            12. Write a method that checks if the given text contains any of the specified terms, with an option to ignore case sensitivity.

13. Write a method that will return a specified number of random elements from a given list.
