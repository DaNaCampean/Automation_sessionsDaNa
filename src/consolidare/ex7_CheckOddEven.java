6 The variables have to be defined, but in this challenge they will be defined for you. All you have to do is check the variables, do some string to integer
conversions, use some if conditions, and apply the arithmetic operation.

7 Write a program called CheckOddEven which prints "Odd Number" if the int variable "number" is odd, or "Even Number" otherwise. The program shall always print "bye!" before exiting.

 public static void evenOrOdd(){
        System.out.println("EVEN OR ODD");
        Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Please enter a number to see if it is EVEN or ODD. iF you want to exit, enter 0");
        int user_input;
        while ((user_input = Integer.valueOf(myScanner.nextLine())) !=0)
        {
            if (user_input % 2 ==0)
            {
                System.out.println("My number is = " + user_input + " - This is an EVEN Number");
            }
            else
            {
                System.out.println("My number is = " + user_input + " - This is an ODD Number");
            }
        }

        System.out.println("You entered zero. Thank you, bye bye");
