    Ticket Sales Monitor
The busiest visiting period for a local attraction is approaching, and the staff needs help
managing ticket sales and calculating the weekly balance. The ticket price varies depending
on the park's visiting schedule, specifically on the time slot. Students receive a 75%
discount, seniors a 50% discount, and children enter for free.
Visiting program:
Monday: 09:00 - 18:00
Tuesday: 11:00 - 19:00
Wednesday: 08:00 - 17:00
Thursday: 09:00 - 20:00
Friday: 10:00 - 18:00.
Ticket Prices:
08:00 - 12:00 | Price: $10.0
12:00 - 17:00 | Price: $20.0
17:00 - 20:00 | Price: $30.0
● Implement the visiting timetable of the local attraction using a Map implementation of
your choice in which the keys are days of the week and the values are time intervals
(opening and closing hours).
● Create a boolean method called isOpen that will take as parameters the day of the
week and the time of the arrival (e.g. hour) and returns true if the local attractions is
open on that time or false otherwise.
● Create a method that calculates and returns the price based on the type of ticket
(child, student, adult, or senior) and the time at which it is purchased.
● Create a Java program that will allow the user to register purchases until the user
decides to exit.
● Implement a way to keep track of the total revenue for each visiting day. With each
new purchase, the values will be updated.
● Implement a purchase command that will register a new purchase.
○ The day of the week, time and type of the ticket will be specified.
○ If the chosen period does not match the visiting schedule of the local
attraction, display the message: 'The purchase is not valid for the chosen
period.' along with options to select a new period or cancel the purchase.
● Implement a command to provide the following statistics: the day with the highest
sales, the day with the lowest sales, the average sales for the entire week, and the
total number of sales for the week.
● Implement an exit command that will allow the user to exit the program.
